## Description
Certainly, I can help you create a project description for your N64 Level Editor. Here's a basic description:

---

**Project Name:** N64 Level Editor

**Description:**
The N64 Level Editor is a Windows application designed to simplify the creation and editing of levels for Nintendo 64 (N64) games. It provides a user-friendly interface with the following key features:

1. **3D Editor Window:** A real-time 3D editor view that allows users to visualize and modify the game world in a 3D space. You can pan, zoom, and rotate the view for precise level design.

2. **Actor Management:** Easily add, position, and manage in-game actors, such as characters, objects, and enemies. Customize their properties and behavior within the level.

3. **File Explorer:** A file management system that enables users to save and load level files, providing seamless access to their projects.

4. **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean and intuitive user interface that streamlines the level design process, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.

**Technical Details:**
- Development Platform: Windows OS
- Programming Language: [Insert programming language]
- 3D Rendering: [Insert 3D rendering library or technology]
- File Management: [Insert file management method or library]

**Goals:**
- To provide a tool that empowers game developers and modders to create custom levels for N64 games.
- To enhance the efficiency and ease of level design for the N64 platform.

**Target Audience:**
- Game developers, modders, and hobbyists interested in N64 game level design.
- Anyone looking for a user-friendly, accessible tool for creating custom N64 game levels.

Feel free to tailor this description to your specific project's goals and technical details. If you have any specific questions or need assistance with a particular aspect of the project, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help further.
## TODO List
1. **Source Code Files**:
   - You'll need source code files for your application. These could be written in a language like C++.
   - Main.cpp: This is where your application starts.
   - Actor.cpp: Implement functions for adding and positioning actors.
   - 3DEditor.cpp: Code for the 3D editor window.
   - FileExplorer.cpp: Code for the file explorer component.

2. **Header Files**:
   - These include declarations and function prototypes.
   - Main.h: Declarations for your main.cpp file.
   - Actor.h: Declarations for actor-related functions.
   - 3DEditor.h: Declarations for the 3D editor window.
   - FileExplorer.h: Declarations for the file explorer.

3. **Resource Files**:
   - These files might include icons, images, and dialog templates.
   - LevelEditor.rc: Resource file for defining application resources.
   - Icons and Images: Store icons and images used in your application.

4. **Configuration Files**:
   - If your application has settings or configuration options, you might use configuration files.
   - Config.ini: Store application settings like default paths.

5. **3D Model Files**:
   - If you're dealing with 3D models, store them in a separate directory.
   - Models/Actor1.obj: 3D model files for actors.

6. **UI Files**:
   - If you're creating a graphical user interface (GUI), you might use UI files.
   - UI.ui: UI layout file for your application.

7. **Documentation Files**:
   - Consider adding documentation for your code and application.
   - README.md: A README file with instructions and information about your project.

8. **Build Configuration Files**:
   - If you're using a build system like CMake, include build configuration files.
   - CMakeLists.txt: For configuring your build process.

9. **Version Control Files**:
   - If you're using version control (e.g., Git), include relevant files.
   - .gitignore: To specify which files should be ignored in version control.

10. **Executable File**:
    - After compiling your application, you'll get an executable file.
    - YourApp.exe: The executable file for your N64 level editor.

11. **Libraries and Dependencies**:
    - If your application depends on external libraries, manage them here.
    - Dependencies/: Directory for external libraries.
